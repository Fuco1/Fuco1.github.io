<h1 class="title">WAR STORY: When turning to the profiler turns out to be a good call</h1>

<p>
Some of you might have seen the little bit of news circulating around
about my new project.  It's called <a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/Elsa">Elsa</a> (stands for Emacs Lisp Static
Analyzer), which is exactly what you would expect: you throw it some
Elisp code and it analyzes the types, dead code, style and all sorts
of other rules (stars are the limit!).
</p>

<p>
I've been working on this "secretly" in public (the repo was on Github
from day 1.) for about a year and very early on I've made a couple
decisions that I now thought doomed me to failure.  These were:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I will use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/eieio/">EIEIO</a> to represent the reader forms and types</li>
<li>I will use CL <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Generic-Functions.html">generics</a> to process these objects</li>
</ul>

<p>
For this kind of a problem where we are walking some recursive
structure and then doing some "arithmetics" on hierarchies of types,
classes and methods are a very natural choice.  You can write generic
implementations and then "pattern match" on specific classes to
provide more elaborate strategies.
</p>

<p>
These two were notoriously known for having very bad performance in
the past, but nonetheless I decided that the simplicity of the
implementation has higher priority for me now and that in the worst
case I can transform it into a manual-dispatch-conds-and-defuns later.
</p>

<p>
EIEIO in particular was also known to be quite undebuggable.  They did
a good job on it with the 25 release and the error messages are now
pretty helpful.  It's no worse than the rest of Emacs (<code>M-x
faint-praise</code>).
</p>

<p>
When I finally finished the reader module which turns the source file
into a tree of EIEIO objects, to my horror I found out that it was
indeed slow. <b>Way slow</b>. I was using <a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/blob/master/smartparens.el">smartparens.el</a> as a benchmark: it's
a single lisp file package of about 10000 lines with enough complexity
to inhibit most of the features of Elisp.
</p>

<p>
It took 42 seconds to analyze.  That is not great when you want to use
it with something like <a href="http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">flycheck</a>.  So I'm pretty much thinking I'm
screwed at this point and begin thinking about how to get rid of the
generics, because obviously <i>that</i> must be the issue, right?
</p>

<p>
Oh, how wrong I was.  Finally in a stroke of genius I fired up an
<code>emacs -nw -q</code>, loaded all the necessary things and did <code>M-x
profiler-start</code>.
</p>

<p>
Then I run the analysis in that instance, get the report and get my
mind blown to pieces: the culprit was the little innocent looking
function <code>line-number-at-pos</code>.  The reader spent about 90% of all the
time inside that function.
</p>

<p>
What happened?  Every time I read any form I need to remember the line
and column it was encountered at for error reporting to the user
later.  So every time I read anything (a symbol, a list, a keyword, a
string) I would call <code>line-number-at-pos</code> with the token's start
position to get the line number.
</p>

<p>
What this function does is it jumps to the first line of the file,
then regexp searches for <code>\n</code> until it reaches the <code>point</code> from which it
was called.
</p>

<p>
So you can imagine, in your source code on line <code>8500</code>, a form like
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp"><span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>very innocent looking form at line 8500<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
would trigger 8 calls to <code>line-number-at-pos</code> which would in turn do
68000 regexp searches for <code>\n</code>.  The total number of these went way up
in the lower hundreds of millions, somewhere around the marks of 400
to 500 million calls.  Now that's <i>a lot</i> of completely useless
computation.
</p>

<p>
So what I did to fix this?  At the beginning of the analysis I run
through all the lines and place a text property <code>elsa-line</code> on the first
character with the line number.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp"><span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>goto-char <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>point-min<span style="color: #888a85;">))</span>
<span style="color: #888a85;">(</span><span style="color: #b4fa70;">let</span> <span style="color: #888a85;">((</span>line 1<span style="color: #888a85;">))</span>
  <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>put-text-property <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>point<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span> <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>1+ <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>point<span style="color: #888a85;">))</span> <span style="color: #e6a8df;">'elsa-line</span> line<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span>
  <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span><span style="color: #b4fa70;">while</span> <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>= <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>forward-line<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span> 0<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span>
    <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span><span style="color: #b4fa70;">cl-incf</span> line<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span>
    <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>put-text-property <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>point<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span> <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>min
                                <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>buffer-size<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span>
                                <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>1+ <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>point<span style="color: #888a85;">)))</span> <span style="color: #e6a8df;">'elsa-line</span> line<span style="color: #888a85;">)))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then to get the line number all I need to do is
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp"><span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>get-text-property <span style="color: #888a85;">(</span>line-beginning-position<span style="color: #888a85;">)</span> <span style="color: #e6a8df;">'elsa-line</span><span style="color: #888a85;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Because the text properties use efficient data structures this access
is really really fast (something like <code>O(log n)</code> in length of buffer).
</p>

<p>
With this little change, the analysis time dropped to 5 seconds,
almost a factor of 10!  So the moral of the story is, as has been
repeated to death, when in trouble always bring out the big guns:
profilers are our friends!  No way in the world I would've guessed
this function was responsible (I actually started changing a bunch of
code into <code>defsubst</code> and inlining code before I figured that's
completely bonkers).
</p>

<p>
On a closing note, I'm looking for people to help out on the project,
there is a lot of things for people of all skill ranging from
beginners to seasoned hackers.  Check out issues marked <a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/Elsa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">help wanted</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/Elsa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">good first issue</a> and get involved!  If anything's unclear go ahead and
ask questions.
