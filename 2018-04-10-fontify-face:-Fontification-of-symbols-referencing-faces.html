<h1 class="title">fontify-face: Fontification of symbols referencing faces</h1>

<p>
Today I was updating <a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/.emacs.d/tree/master/themes">my theme</a> to support some additional packages.
I'm a big fan of face inheritance because it makes things very
consistent across the board.  In particular I'm trying to reuse the
faces in the <code>font-lock-</code> group as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
I have even created a similar hierarchy for the various markup systems
such as markdown, org mode, rst, textile, latex and others.  It's
called, unsurprisingly, <code>markup</code> and contains all the common elements
such as headers, code text, emphasis and so on.  I then make all the
other modes inherit from this set of faces and thus achieve a
consistent look and feel across all the markup
modes.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.  Have a look at the definitions if this
makes no sense to you yet!
</p>

<p>
Anyway, while I was working on adding new faces I got annoyed because
I couldn't see what I was doing.  I sometimes inherit from multiple
faces to make combined faces, sometimes I just add a parameter or two
and it's difficult to see the results. Usually you need to switch to a
different buffer (with the mode you are theming), find the desired
element and look what's going on.
</p>

<p>
Why couldn't the face name itself be fontified with the face? A ha!  I
already use <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/rainbow-mode.html">rainbow-mode</a> which colorizes color references such as
#fafafa with the color they represent.  So I'm thinking along the same
lines: the symbols representing faces should be fontified with that
face.  This will make the feedback loop much shorter and the
development much faster and more convenient.
</p>

<p>
I have quickly turned this idea into a package and called it
<a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/fontify-face">fontify-face</a>.  The code is rather unsurprising, just a couple lines.
The most interesting part is the function
<code>fontify-face-colorize-matched-face</code> which computes the face from the
matched region and then passes it back to font-lock to do its thing.
</p>

<p>
This works because font-lock allows arbitrary forms in every place
where you can pass a face reference.  The rule is, this form must
evaluate to
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a face reference,</li>
<li>or a plist representing face properties,</li>
<li>or nil if we don't want do do anything with the match.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The form I use is <code>(funcall 'fontify-face-colorize-matched-face)</code>
because I dislike just passing random blobs of code around.  This way
I can redefine the function without having to mess around with
removing the old forms from <code>font-lock-keywords-alist</code>.  This is similar
in logic to why you shouldn't put lambda forms in hooks.
</p>

<p>
So that's it folks.  Finally, here are some pictures:
