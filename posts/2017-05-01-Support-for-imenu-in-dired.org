=imenu= is a very simple package that builds index of /interesting/ positions in the current buffer and presents them as a menu.  You pick the item and the point moves there.  There is a built-in interface and also one in [[https://github.com/Fuco1/sallet][sallet]], [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] or [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel]].

Unfortunatelly =dired= doesn't come with support for it, so here I add some definitions to generate the index of all the inserted directories.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my-dired-imenu-prev-index-position (&optional arg)
  "Go to the header line of previous directory."
  (interactive "p")
  (unless (= (line-number-at-pos) 1)
    (call-interactively 'dired-prev-subdir)
    t))

(defun my-dired-extract-index-name ()
  "Extract name of the current item for imenu."
  (save-excursion
    (back-to-indentation)
    (buffer-substring-no-properties
     (point)
     (1- (re-search-forward ":$")))))

(defun my-dired-imenu-create-index ()
  "Create `imenu' index for dired."
  (let* ((alist (imenu-default-create-index-function))
         (uniquified (f-uniquify-alist (-map 'car alist))))
    (--remove (= 0 (length (car it))) (--map (cons (cdr (assoc (car it) uniquified)) (cdr it)) alist))))

(defun my-dired-imenu-init ()
  "Initialize `imenu' variables in current buffer."
  (setq-local imenu-prev-index-position-function 'my-dired-imenu-prev-index-position)
  (setq-local imenu-extract-index-name-function 'my-dired-extract-index-name)
  (setq-local imenu-create-index-function 'my-dired-imenu-create-index))
#+END_SRC

To use this just add =my-dired-imenu-init= to =dired-mode-hook=.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'my-dired-imenu-init)
#+END_SRC

The code depends on =f= and =dash=.
