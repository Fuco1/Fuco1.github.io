By default org mode only fontifies spans of text wrapped in emphasis
markers (customized with =org-emphasis-alist=) if they extend through at
most one newline.  This is probably a performance optimization, one
wholly unnecessary on modern hardware.

As per this [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/18101/org-mode-multi-line-emphasis-and-bold][stack overflow]] post I re-set the constant to 10 lines and
can probably even increase it if necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setcar (nthcdr 4 org-emphasis-regexp-components) 10)
#+END_SRC

Before this starts to work you need to re-save =org-emphasis-alist=
through the customize interface because it is using a custom setter
=org-set-emph-re= to compute the regexpses (or, /*gulp*/, restart Emacs).

Here I quote the answer in case it ever gets lost:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
By default, org-mode allows a single newline. So if you want to be
able to add markup to text that spans more than two consecutive lines,
you'll need to modify this entry.

    (setcar (nthcdr 4 org-emphasis-regexp-components) N)

... where N is the number of newlines you want to allow.
#+END_SRC
