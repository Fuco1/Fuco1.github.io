<h1 class="title">Collapse unique nested paths in dired with dired-collapse-mode</h1>

<p>
 Often times we find ourselves in a situation where a single file or
directory is nested in a chain of nested directories with no other
content. This is sometimes due to various mandatory layouts demanded by
packaging tools or tools generating these deeply-nested "unique" paths
to disambiguate architectures or versions (but we often use only one
anyway). If the user wants to access these directories they have to
quite needlessly drill-down through varying number of "uninteresting"
directories to get to the content.
</p>

<p>
This minor mode is in main inspired by how GitHub renders these paths:
if there is a chain of directories where each one only has one child,
they are concatenated together and shown on the first level in this
collapsed form. When the user clicks this collapsed directory they are
immediately brought to the deepest directory with some actual content.
</p>

<p>
In case the deepest directory contains only a single file
<code>dired-collapse-mode</code> differs a bit in that this file is displayed
instead of the last directory. This way we can get directly to the
file itself. This is often helpful with config files which are stored
in their own directories, for example in <code>~/.config/foo/config</code> and
similar situations.

</div>

<p>
The files or directories re-inserted in this manner will also have
updated permissions, file sizes and modification dates so they truly
correspond to the properties of the file being shown.
</p>

<p>
The path to the deepest file is dimmed with the <code>shadow</code> face so that it
does not distract but at the same time is still available for
inspection.
</p>

<p>
The mode is integrated with <code>dired-rainbow</code> so the nested files are
properly colored according to user's rules.

This package was created mainly due to the excellent <a href="https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks/issues/85">feature request</a> by the GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/kidd">@kidd</a>.  Thanks!
